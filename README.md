# More backend, eh?
Backend has always kicked my ass and I have had enough! From now on, I will get more invovled on the backend aspects of projects. In fact, I will accomplish this by being a part of the YURS software team. Of course, rovers are cool on their own but to actual make one think and compute is something else. 

## DETAILS
- ROS2 (Humble Hawksbill(
- Python
- Ubuntu

## DRAWBACKS
- No drawbacks to be honest. It could be argued that I spent more time than necessary on this project. That said, since it was my first time using ROS2, I could care less lol. Furthermore, I was more interested in learning and soaking in as much knowledge as I can so I can be a more contributing member of the YURS software team.

## TAKEAWAYS
- Just put in the practice and the results will show. No need to get discouraged. Also, never be shy and not ask others for help!

## SHOUT-OUTS
Thank you to the YURS software team co-lead for helping me out (not going to reveal his name for anonymity reasons)

Also, I would like to thank all these articles for helping me when it got too tough (yes, theres a lot):
