# More backend, eh?
Backend has always kicked my ass and I have had enough! From now on, I will get more invovled on the backend aspects of projects. In fact, I plan to accomplish this by being a part of the York University Robotics Society software team. With everything, there is the good and the bad. In this case, the good is being surrounded by very talented, driven people who will do their utmost to get the job done. On the other hand, the bad is that... theres no bad lol! Originally, I would have intepreted the backend programming to be bad but now I see it as an oppurtunity to get better. Albeit, there is a steep learning curve which slightly frightens me but I know, deep down, that if I put in the work, then I will be alright (probably excelling). Anyways, this repo pertains to my first assignment in the software team. 

## DETAILS
- ROS2 (Humble Hawksbill)
- Python
- Ubuntu

## DRAWBACKS
- No drawbacks to be honest. It could be argued that I spent more time than necessary on this project. That said, since it was my first time using ROS2, I could care less lol. Furthermore, I was more interested in learning and soaking in as much knowledge as I can so I can be a more contributing member of the YURS software team.

## TAKEAWAYS
- Just put in the practice and the results will show. No need to get discouraged. Also, never be shy and not ask others for help!

## SHOUT-OUTS
Thank you to the YURS software team co-lead for helping me out (not going to reveal his name for anonymity reasons)

Also, I would like to thank all these articles for helping me when it got too tough (yes, theres a lot):
